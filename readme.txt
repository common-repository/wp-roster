WP Roster is a robust roster system for WordPress

== Description ==

WP Roster is a unique roster plugin designed for WordPress. WP Roster comes with a fully-fledged application interface and is designed to take up the whole window of your site - the plugin comes with a custom page template to make this easily achievable so you can still maintain the existing look on your other pages. However, for most use cases, and what I recommend, is using the plugin on a barebones WordPress install on a subdomain. The plugin has been tested with the free Twenty Sixteen theme so for best results it is recommended to use this theme as otherwise additional CSS work may be required.

WP Roster has been designed specifically for church service rostering however the plugin can be used for a wide range of team and event applications. Maybe if you run an event company this could be handy or perhaps you have a team or business that has daily/weekly/monthly tasks or roles.

The plugin takes a table approach to presenting data as oppose to the more traditional calendar interface. This might not work for you but for certain contexts where each event has a bit going on this table view makes a lot more sense. With WP Roster you can create multiple dates, teams, members and lists and then on your main roster page allocate members to dates and teams with ease.

For churches and other organisations, WP Roster creates a great middle-ground option which sits between having a full-blown CRM system which can be clunky and can require a lot of resources to maintain - and not to mention typically high ongoing fees and not having true ownership of your data; and DIY Excel spreadsheets which are hard to share, don't look and work too great and aren't the best solution to organise teams and events. Although WP Roster isn't a full CRM system, it does use the built-in WordPress user system so you could extend the plugin however you want to! For example, it would be very easy to install a WordPress MailChimp user sync plugin to add all your members to MailChimp for ongoing emails etc.

Every aspect of the plugin has been meticulously designed to present a truly beautiful and simple frontend and backend interface which is mobile friendly.

Creating and deploying rosters is incredibly fast and easy. The plugin also comes with a setting restoration page so if you make a mistake you can easily roll back changes. The plugin has been made translation friendly except for popups - which I will make translatable based on demand.

= Upgrade to pro =
WP Roster is great but it is very limited compared to WP Roster Pro - in many respects this free version should be considered as a taster for those that need a really great roster system. WP Roster Pro comes with the following features:

- Ability to create multiple rosters
- Ability to send conditional and dynamic automated notifications including SMS and email notifications (SMS charges are not included)
- Ability to upload members from a CSV file
- Add multiple dates with a click of a button
- Unavailable rows so users can add in their unavailability for those creating the roster with roster clash highlighting
- A dynamic run sheet template for each roster
- Take attendance of groups and rosters/services
- Custom member fields
- Super awesome support

For most teams and organisations these are must-have features so [upgrade to pro today](https://northernbeacheswebsites.com.au/wp-roster-pro/)
